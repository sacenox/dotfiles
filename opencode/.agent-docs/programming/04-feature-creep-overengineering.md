# Feature Creep

- Uncontrolled scope growth harms focus, quality, and timelines.
- Define and protect the minimum valuable feature set.
- Add features only with clear user value and acceptable cost.

- IEEE: "Toward preprototype user acceptance testing" (Davis & Venkatesh, 2004) - identifies feature creep as top cause of cost/schedule overruns

# Overengineering

- Extra complexity beyond the problem size increases risk and slows delivery.
- Choose the smallest solution that meets real constraints.
- Avoid unnecessary frameworks, abstractions, or configurability.
- Use measurements to justify optimization or architecture changes.
