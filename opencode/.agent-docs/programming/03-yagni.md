# YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Build for current requirements, not hypothetical ones.
- Defer generalization until you have a concrete use case.
- Prefer small extension points over speculative flexibility.
- Originated from Extreme Programming (XP); works best with continuous refactoring and testing.
