# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Keep a single source of truth for logic, rules, and data.
- Remove copy-paste by extracting shared functions or modules.
- Avoid premature abstraction; small duplication can be acceptable if it preserves clarity.
- Consider AHA (Avoid Hasty Abstractions): abstract when duplication becomes a barrier and the abstraction's shape is clear.
