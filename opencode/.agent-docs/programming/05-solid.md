# SOLID

Introduced by Robert C. Martin; acronym coined by Michael Feathers (c. 2004).

- Single Responsibility: one reason to change; keep modules focused.
- Open/Closed: extend via new code, avoid modifying stable paths.
- Liskov Substitution: derived types must work in place of base types.
- Interface Segregation: small, specific interfaces; avoid fat contracts.
- Dependency Inversion: depend on abstractions, invert control at boundaries.
